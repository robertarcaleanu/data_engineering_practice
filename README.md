# Data Engineering Practice

## Github Configuration
- Download Git from [this](https://git-scm.com/downloads) page.
- Connecting to GitHub with SSH. More details on [this](https://decodementor.medium.com/connect-git-to-github-using-ssh-68ab338f4523) article.

## Docker Configuration

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

Note that we need to add the user to the docker group. See documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

## Environment Set Up
We are are going to use devcontainers. We can follow these tutorials for the configuration:
- [Tutorial 1](https://towardsdatascience.com/setting-a-dockerized-python-environment-the-elegant-way-f716ef85571d)
- [Tutorial 2](https://marioscalas.medium.com/using-python-and-poetry-inside-a-dev-container-33c80bc5a22c)

## Cloud Provider
There a three major cloud providers (AWS, GCP and Azure). These are somehow similar, but let's use AWS in this case. You can visit the official [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com/es/resources/create-account/) to create an account. It has a free tier, but a card is required to create the account.
